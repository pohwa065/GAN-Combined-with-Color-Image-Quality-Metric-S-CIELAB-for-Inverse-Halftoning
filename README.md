# GAN-Combined-with-Color-Image-Quality-Metric-S-CIELAB-for-Inverse-Halftoning
## Introduction
S-CIELAB is an extension of the CIE Lab* Delta E color difference formula and provides human spatial sensitivity difference between a reference and a corresponding test image. The proposed work is to use S-CIELAB delta E maps as generator perceptual loss in GAN to incorporate human spatial color sensitivity during model training.

**S-CIELAB:** Consisted of color transformation and spatial filtering steps for pattern-color separation
